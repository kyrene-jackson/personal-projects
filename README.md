*GUESSING GAME*
1. A simple game in which the computer picks a number and the player must guess it using the least amount of turns as possible. But there's a twist! The computer provides you with hints that may or may not be true!<br>
2. Primary concept focus: Exploring new ways to organize and store data and methods together in classes.

*SHORT STRAW*
3. A game in which the computer uses a pre generated group of players to execute a series of straws varying in length. Each straw will be randomly assigned to each player. The player with the shortest straw each turn will be eliminated each turn. The game finishes when only one player remains. Can you guess which player is going to win?
4. Primary concept focus: A deeper look into the Array object.
