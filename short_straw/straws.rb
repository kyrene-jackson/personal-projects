# Ruby For Kids Project 7: Straws
# Tutorial By: Chris Haupt
# Programmed By: Kyrene Jackson
# Elimination-round, tournament-style, avoid the
# shortest straw, or else!
#
#
# Game Skeleton:
# This game will be played among a group of pre-created players.
# Each round, the game will create a set of straws of varying lengths.
# It will count how many players remain in the game
# and assign a straw to each player.
# It will print a message stating the current round number,
# and display the straws held by each player.
# The game will remove the player holding the shortest straw.
# If there is more than one player remaining, a new round will start.
# When only one player remains, the game will end and display the winner.
